# Heart-Disease-ML-Pipeline
# ðŸ«€ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict the presence of heart disease using the UCI Heart Disease dataset. It covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and performance comparison across multiple algorithms.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used in this project comes from the "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease".
It contains patient medical records and diagnostic results to determine the presence of heart disease.

- **Features:** Age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, etc.
- **Target:** Presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease.
